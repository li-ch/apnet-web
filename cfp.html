<p> The 1st ACM Asia-Pacific Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (APNet 2017) will bring together 
researchers in computer networks and systems to engage in a lively debate on the theory and 
practice of computer networking. APNet provides a venue for discussing innovative ideas 
and for debating future research agendas in networking.
</p>

<p>
We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. The workshop seeks 
to foster discussions that can shape research agendas for the networking community as a whole. 
Thus, we strongly encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, offer a constructive 
critique of the state of networking research, or present and explain new opportunities as well as challenges.
</p>

<p>
We also encourage submissions of early-stage work describing promising but unproven ideas. 
Submissions can, for example, advocate a new approach, re-frame or debunk existing work, 
report unexpected early results from a deployment, or propose new evaluation methodologies. 
Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary 
evaluations can support the possibility of the paperâ€™s claims.  When fully developed and 
supported by more experimental evidence, we expect follow-on work to be published at related 
conferences such as SIGCOMM, SOSP, OSDI, SenSys, NSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, PODC, CoNEXT, or INFOCOM. 
Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at either CoNEXT or IMC.
</p>

<p>
APNet takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to 
(but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a 
variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks 
and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks, including (but not limited to) 
packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, 
performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, 
verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, and usability 
of underlying networking technologies.
</p>

<p>
Position papers will be selected based on originality, likelihood of stimulating insightful 
discussion at the workshop, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior 
to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library, thereby widely disseminating 
the ideas discussed at the workshop.
</p>

<h1>Workshop Participation</h1>

<p>
APNet attendance is open to the community.
</p>

<h1>Submission Instructions</h1>
<p>
Submitted papers must be no longer than 6 pages (10 point font, 12 point leading, 7 inch by 9.25 inch text block)
including all content and references. 
You can find a .tgz file <a href="apnet17.tgz">here</a> with the necessary LaTeX files to create a template. 
You can find a pdf copy of the template <a href="hotnets17.pdf">here</a>. 
All submissions must be blind: submissions must not
indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF
will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools
(e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Papers must contain novel ideas and must
differ significantly in content from previously published papers and papers under simultaneous
submission. 

</p>

<p>
<b>The submission website: <a href=https://apnet17.hotcrp.com>https://apnet17.hotcrp.com</a> is open for registration and submission!</b>
